Terraform module for deploying Kubernetes [AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)](https://aws.github.io/aws-controllers-k8s/), lets you define and use AWS service resources directly from Kubernetes.

With ACK, you can take advantage of AWS managed services for your Kubernetes applications without needing to define resources outside of the cluster or run services that provide supporting capabilities like databases or message queues within the cluster.

## Usage

```bash
module "ack" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-eks-ack.git?ref=0.1.0"

  enabled = true

  helm_services = [
    {
      name          = "s3"
      policy_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess"
      settings      = {}
    },
    {
      name          = "sns"
      policy_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSNSFullAccess"
      settings      = {}
    },
    {
      name          = "sfn"
      policy_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess"
      settings      = {}
    },
    {
      name          = "elasticache"
      policy_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonElastiCacheFullAccess"
      settings      = {}
    },
    {
      name          = "ecr"
      policy_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
      settings      = {}
    },
    {
      name          = "dynamodb"
      policy_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess"
      settings      = {}
    },
    {
      name          = "apigatewayv2"
      policy_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator"
      settings      = {}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Connecting Kubernetes and AWS APIs

![ack-birdseye-view](./images/ack-birdseye-view.png)

[ACK](https://github.com/aws/aws-controllers-k8s/) is a collection of [Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CRDs) and controllers which work together to extend the Kubernetes API and create AWS resources on your clusterâ€™s behalf.

ACK comprises a set of Kubernetes custom [controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true#term-controller). Each controller manages [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) representing API resources of a single AWS service API. For example, the ACK service controller for AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) manages custom resources that represent AWS S3 buckets.

Instead of logging into the AWS console or using the aws CLI tool to interact with the AWS service API, Kubernetes users can install a controller for an AWS service and then create, update, read and delete AWS resources using the Kubernetes API.

This means they can use the Kubernetes API and configuration language to fully describe both their containerized applications, using Kubernetes resources like Deployment and Service, as well as any AWS service resources upon which those applications depend.

## Demo

#### S3 Bucket

```yaml
apiVersion: s3.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: "<redact>"
  namespace: default
spec:
  name: "<redact>"
```

#### ECR Repository

```yaml
apiVersion: "ecr.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: "<redact>"
spec:
  repositoryName: <redact>
  encryptionConfiguration:
      encryptionType: AES256
  tags:
  - key: "is-encrypted"
    value: "true"
```
